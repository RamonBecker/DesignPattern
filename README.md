# Fireman Design Pattern
> Project developed for the discipline of project standards with the simulation of a fire brigade system
## :information_source: Information 

Design patterns make it easy to reuse successful solutions and architectures to build object-oriented software in a flexible and easy to maintain manner. The use of design patterns can reduce the complexity of the software design process. In addition, well-designed object-oriented software enables designers to reuse and employ pre-existing components in future systems.

For each design pattern developed, a simple diagram was made to model the system. The diagrams are in the repository itself. And, a video was made explaining the functioning of the functionality developed for each design pattern.

The design patterns developed were:

- Strategy
- Null objects
- Hook methods
- Bridge
- State
- Observer
- Composite
- Chain of resposibility
- Proxy e Decorator
 - Factory
 - Command
 - Double Dispatch
 - Facade
 - Fluent Interfaces
 - Flyweigth

The theme of the project was a simulation of a fire brigade system for inspecting buildings in response to occurrences.
